a Twinkle twinkle, little star
b Mary had a little lamb
b Its Fleece was white as snow
c Freres Jacques, freres Jacques
a How I wonder what you are
a Up above the roof so high
b And everywhere that Mary went
c Dormez vous, dormex vous
b the lamb was sure to go
c Sonnez les matines, sonnex les matines
a Like a diamon in the sky
c Ding dang dong, ding dang dong
